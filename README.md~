## Summary

Converts from English to Pig-Latin, and back again

### Problem

Pig Latin is an English-language word game, usually played by children, in which words are mutated systematically. 

A word that begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) has the syllable “way” added to the end; for instance, art becomes art-way and eagle becomes eagle-way. 

A word that begins with one or more consonants has the initial consonants stripped, moved to the end of the word, then the syllable “ay” is added; for instance, start becomes art-stay and door becomes oor-day. 

A hyphen is added as shown above as an aid to prevent ambiguity; otherwise, a word like aspray could be the translation of spray (ay-spray) or prays (ays-pray).

### Solution

### Setup

### Tests

### Images

### To do

Functions have some issues with the handling of capitalisation, and treatment of words which begin with 'w' followed by a vowel (tranlsation back into english is ambiguous)
